  - When hovered over, the heading of the article becomes underlined and a small dropbox appears around the background to highlight the box the user's mouse is hovering over.

- The third section is the Projects section. This displays various projects that I have worked on. Currently, it houses templates as there are no projects currently available.

  - When the container holding the image and caption is hovered over, the image blurs and a text box appears, allowing the user to view the project via a hyperlink.

  - Currently, the template takes the user to Projects section until a viewable project becomes available.
